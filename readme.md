BARKEEPER (Revised from class version)

I really enjoyed this project and wanted to make it better.  I am in the process of deconstructing and reconstructing this application so it is more in my aesthetic.  I also made changes to the Jquery Dom Manipulation.



An online cocktail recipe database in which a user can find drink recipes from a search using liquory type, drink name or ingredient.
A search query into the database can also find a drink based on what ingredients a user has on-hand.  In addition, a user can add a recipe into the database.
