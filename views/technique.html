<h3>Here's a few techniques you can use when making that perfect drink.</h3>
<img src="../../assets/img/technique.png" alt="techniques">

<h3> SHAKING </h3>
<p>
As a rule of thumb, shake any drink made with juices, syrup or sugar, egg, or cream to be sure that the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Pour the ingredients into the glass mixing part of the Boston shaker, with spirits first, then juices, and then the sweeteners and other flavorings, such as bitters. If you are trying to learn a drink recipe by heart, you can alter the sequence to go from largest amount of ingredients to the smallest, as that seems a reasonable and reliable way to remember a long list. Pouring the ingredients into the mixer glass before adding the ice premixes them before the more thorough shaking.</p>
<p>
Now add ice to the mixer to fill it about two-thirds full, as you want to leave room for the ingredients to be able to move freely during shaking. Egg-based drinks, such as Flips, are an important exception. In their case, the ingredients are first combined and shaken without ice to make an emulsion and then the ice is added for a second shaking to chill the drink. And never shake a drink with soda, as the action will burst the bubbles, but add the soda to top off the drink after it is poured.
</p>

<h3> STIRRING </h3>
<p>
When the drink is comprised of spirits alone, stir the ingredients so they remain clear and unclouded by shaking. After you’ve assembled your liquids and ice in the mixer glass, insert the barspoon, letting the handle of the spoon rest on the edge of the glass. Move the spoon around the edge of the glass in a circle for at least thirty seconds to completely chill the cocktail, while also allowing sufficient time for a small amount of the ice to melt.

</p>

<h3> SWIZZLING </h3>
<p>
Any drinker knows the swizzle stick—the long decorative plastic rod jutting out of a tall (also called long) cocktail that serves as a stirrer. A proper swizzle stick is actually made from wood, getting its name from the long, straight branches of the Caribbean swizzlestick tree, or all spice bush. The swizzle stick lends its name to an entire category of iced thirst-quenchers that are stirred in a special way to frost the outside of the serving glass.</p>
<p>
A barspoon, which is long enough to reach the bottom of the deepest glass, can be used as a swizzle stick. Pour the ingredients into the serving glass (usually a Collins or hurricane glass) and add the ice. Insert the barspoon. Place both palms around the twisted part of the handle. Move your hands back and forth and up and down to quickly rotate and lift the spoon until the glass is nicely frosted. When serving the drink, hold it by its rim with a cocktail napkin, so as not to mar the frosting.
</p>

<h3> ROLLING </h3>
<p>
This technique prevents drinks that call for thick juices or fruit purees from foaming. (It is also somewhat of a timesaver and gives the bartender an occasional break from shaking.) Pour the ingredients over ice in the mixing glass of a Boston shaker. Pour the drink back and forth between the glass and metal shaker half two or three times until combined. Strain the drink into the prepared serving glass.</p>
